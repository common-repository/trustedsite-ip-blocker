Protect your site by blocking known attackers.

== Description ==

**Keep pesky visitors away from your site. With IP Blocker, you can create custom rules to block traffic by IP Address(es), Browser, Hostname, and HTTP referer.**

Prevent trolls, hackers, robots, fraudulent buyers, and more from coming back to your site. The IP blocker will detect the IP address of your visitors and will allow you to block them from your site.

= How it works =

Once you've identified a visitor that you'd like to block, and if you know their IP address, you can set up a blocking rule to prevent that user from coming back to your site. Another way to block users, is by viewing your traffic log and clicking the 'Block this IP' button next to the user. 

Each visit is checked against each created rule and if it matches any one rule, the user will be blocked and will be be presented with a 404 page-not-found message.

You can view your IP Blocker dashboard at anytime to make real time changes and updates to your blocked IPs.
